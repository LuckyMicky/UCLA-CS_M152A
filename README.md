# UCLA-CS_M152A
Introductory Digital Design Laboratory, Spring 2017

Introduction

In this lab class you will get hands-on experience with design implementation on Field Programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGAs). You will apply what you've learned in CS51A (combinatorial and sequential logic) and implement some designs using modern design tools and Hardware Description Language (HDL).

We have designed several projects for you to implement using the Xilinx ISE design and implementation environment. These projects are intended as tutorials for you to learn how to put designs together, implement them in Verilog HDL, generate the programming file, as well as proving the design both in simulation and on real hardware.

The projects are not designed in such a way that you will spend a significant amount of time in the lab while keeping yourself awake with lots of caffeinated drinks. Instead you should treat the lab sessions as a time to work with the hardware and interact with the TAs. You will find that working on the designs on your own computer using the free version of ISE (Webpack), and sufficiently simulating the designs ahead of time before testing them on the FPGA boards makes one's life much easier in this course.
